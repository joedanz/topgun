# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create customization system for aircraft
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the system for customizing aircraft appearance and loadouts.
# Details:
Implement paint scheme customization with texture swapping. Create a call sign system with persistent storage. Design a weapon loadout system with slot and weight limitations. Implement a UI for customization with preview capabilities. Add preset options for quick customization. Create a system for saving and loading custom configurations. Implement validation to ensure loadouts meet mission requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test customization options to ensure they apply correctly to aircraft. Verify that saved configurations persist between sessions. Ensure the customization UI is intuitive and responsive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core data structures for aircraft customization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data models and storage system for aircraft customization options including paint schemes, call signs, and weapon loadouts.
### Details:
Define data structures for storing customization options. Create classes for PaintScheme (with texture references), CallSign (with validation rules), WeaponLoadout (with slot definitions and weight calculations). Implement persistent storage using JSON serialization for saving/loading configurations. Set up the validation system to check if loadouts meet mission requirements based on weight limits and weapon compatibility.

## 2. Develop paint scheme and texture swapping system [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create the system for applying different paint schemes to aircraft models through texture swapping.
### Details:
Implement a TextureManager class to handle loading and swapping textures. Create a material property system that can apply textures to different parts of the aircraft model. Design a PaintSchemeApplicator that takes a PaintScheme object and applies the corresponding textures to the aircraft. Include support for different aircraft types with varying UV maps. Add a caching system to improve performance when switching between previously loaded schemes.

## 3. Build weapon loadout management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement the system for configuring weapon loadouts with slot and weight limitations.
### Details:
Create a WeaponSlotManager to handle the assignment of weapons to specific hardpoints on the aircraft. Implement weight calculation logic that updates in real-time as weapons are added/removed. Design a validation system that checks if a loadout meets mission requirements and aircraft capabilities. Create weapon preset configurations for common loadout types. Implement visual representation of weapons on the aircraft model when loadouts change. Add support for different aircraft types with varying weapon compatibility and slot configurations.

## 4. Develop customization UI with preview capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Create the user interface for aircraft customization with real-time preview functionality.
### Details:
Design and implement UI panels for paint scheme selection, call sign entry, and weapon loadout configuration. Create a 3D preview window that shows the aircraft with current customizations applied in real-time. Implement UI controls for rotating and zooming the preview model. Add visual feedback for invalid configurations (e.g., overweight loadouts). Create preset buttons for quick customization options. Implement a save/load interface for custom configurations with naming and thumbnail preview.

## 5. Implement configuration persistence and mission integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Create systems for saving/loading custom configurations and integrate with mission system for requirement validation.
### Details:
Implement configuration serialization/deserialization to save and load custom setups. Create a library of saved configurations with thumbnail previews. Design a mission requirements validator that checks if the current configuration meets specific mission parameters. Implement a warning system that alerts players when their configuration doesn't meet mission requirements. Add a quick-fix feature that suggests changes to meet requirements. Create an API for mission designers to specify required loadout parameters. Test the entire customization system with various aircraft types and mission scenarios.
