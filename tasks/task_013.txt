# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create customization system for aircraft
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the system for customizing aircraft appearance and loadouts.
# Details:
Implement paint scheme customization with texture swapping. Create a call sign system with persistent storage. Design a weapon loadout system with slot and weight limitations. Implement a UI for customization with preview capabilities. Add preset options for quick customization. Create a system for saving and loading custom configurations. Implement validation to ensure loadouts meet mission requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test customization options to ensure they apply correctly to aircraft. Verify that saved configurations persist between sessions. Ensure the customization UI is intuitive and responsive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core data structures and storage system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data structures and persistence layer for aircraft customization
### Details:
Design and implement data models for aircraft customization including paint schemes, call signs, weapon loadouts, and configurations. Create a persistence system to save/load customization data to local storage. Implement the basic validation logic for loadout weight and slot limitations. This subtask focuses on the data layer without UI components.

## 2. Develop paint scheme and texture swapping system [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create the system for customizing aircraft appearance through texture swapping
### Details:
Implement a texture management system that can dynamically swap aircraft textures. Create a collection of base paint schemes with appropriate texture maps. Develop the logic to apply selected textures to aircraft models at runtime. Include support for different aircraft types having their own texture sets. Test the system with various texture resolutions to ensure performance.

## 3. Build weapon loadout and call sign systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement the functional systems for weapon loadouts and call sign customization
### Details:
Create the weapon loadout system with slot and weight limitations based on aircraft type. Implement the call sign system with validation and formatting rules. Develop the logic for checking if loadouts meet mission requirements. Build preset loadout configurations for different mission types. Ensure these systems properly interface with the persistence layer from subtask 1.

## 4. Create customization UI with preview capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Develop the user interface for all customization options with live preview
### Details:
Design and implement a comprehensive UI for aircraft customization. Include tabs or sections for paint schemes, call signs, and weapon loadouts. Create a 3D preview panel that shows changes in real-time. Implement UI controls for texture selection, call sign input, and weapon selection. Add visual feedback for invalid configurations (weight limits, slot restrictions). Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.

## 5. Implement configuration management and finalize system [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Complete the system with configuration presets, save/load functionality, and final integration
### Details:
Implement the save/load functionality for custom configurations with appropriate naming and categorization. Create a preset system allowing quick selection of pre-defined configurations. Add import/export capabilities for sharing configurations. Implement final validation to ensure configurations meet all requirements. Integrate the complete customization system with the main game flow. Perform comprehensive testing across different aircraft types and configurations.
