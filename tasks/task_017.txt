# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement performance optimization systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create systems for optimizing performance across different devices and platforms.
# Details:
Implement adaptive quality settings based on device capabilities. Create LOD (Level of Detail) system for models and effects. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects. Add occlusion culling for complex scenes. Create asset streaming for large environments. Implement texture compression and resolution scaling. Add performance monitoring tools for debugging. Create user-adjustable quality presets.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance on various target devices. Verify that adaptive quality adjusts appropriately. Measure memory usage and frame rates under different conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement performance monitoring and profiling tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive performance monitoring system to measure and visualize performance metrics across different devices
### Details:
Develop a performance monitoring dashboard that tracks FPS, memory usage, draw calls, and CPU/GPU utilization. Implement logging systems for performance data collection. Create visualization tools for performance bottlenecks. Add markers for key rendering events. This foundation will guide all other optimization efforts and provide metrics to validate improvements.

## 2. Implement adaptive quality settings system [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a system that automatically detects device capabilities and adjusts quality settings accordingly
### Details:
Develop device capability detection for CPU, GPU, memory, and platform. Create a quality settings manager that can dynamically adjust parameters based on detected capabilities. Implement automatic performance testing on startup to determine optimal settings. Design user-adjustable quality presets (Low, Medium, High, Ultra) with appropriate defaults for different device tiers.

## 3. Implement Level of Detail (LOD) system [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create a system to manage multiple detail levels for models and effects based on distance and importance
### Details:
Develop a LOD manager that handles model swapping based on distance from camera. Implement LOD transition smoothing to prevent popping. Create tools for artists to generate and configure LOD models. Add support for effect LOD (particle count/complexity reduction at distance). Integrate with the adaptive quality system to adjust LOD distances based on device performance.

## 4. Implement object pooling and occlusion culling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create systems to efficiently manage object instantiation and visibility determination
### Details:
Develop a generic object pooling system for frequently created/destroyed objects (projectiles, effects, enemies). Implement pre-warming for pools to avoid runtime allocations. Create an occlusion culling system that prevents rendering of objects not visible to the camera. Add portal culling for indoor environments and implement frustum culling optimizations.

## 5. Implement asset streaming and memory management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create systems for efficiently loading and unloading assets based on player location and memory constraints
### Details:
Develop an asset streaming system that loads/unloads assets based on proximity to player. Implement priority-based loading queues. Create memory budgets for different asset types. Add asynchronous loading to prevent frame drops. Implement texture and audio streaming for large assets. Create fallback systems for when memory limits are reached.

## 6. Implement texture optimization and resolution scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.5
### Description: Create systems for texture compression, mipmap generation, and dynamic resolution scaling
### Details:
Implement texture compression appropriate for each platform (ETC2, ASTC, BC7, etc.). Create mipmap generation and management. Develop a dynamic resolution scaling system that adjusts render resolution based on performance. Add texture atlasing for UI and small textures. Implement texture streaming for large textures. Create texture quality options that integrate with the quality presets system.
