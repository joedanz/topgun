# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement performance optimization systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create systems for optimizing performance across different devices and platforms.
# Details:
Implement adaptive quality settings based on device capabilities. Create LOD (Level of Detail) system for models and effects. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects. Add occlusion culling for complex scenes. Create asset streaming for large environments. Implement texture compression and resolution scaling. Add performance monitoring tools for debugging. Create user-adjustable quality presets.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance on various target devices. Verify that adaptive quality adjusts appropriately. Measure memory usage and frame rates under different conditions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement performance monitoring and profiling tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive performance monitoring system to establish baselines and identify bottlenecks
### Details:
Develop a performance monitoring dashboard that tracks FPS, memory usage, draw calls, and CPU/GPU utilization. Implement frame time analysis tools to identify performance spikes. Create logging systems for performance metrics across different devices. Add visualization tools for performance hotspots. This foundation will guide all other optimization efforts and provide metrics to validate improvements.

## 2. Implement adaptive quality settings system [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a system that automatically detects device capabilities and adjusts quality settings accordingly
### Details:
Develop device capability detection for CPU, GPU, memory, and platform. Create a quality settings manager that can dynamically adjust parameters based on detected capabilities. Implement user-adjustable quality presets (Low, Medium, High, Ultra) with appropriate defaults for each detected device tier. Include options for manual overrides. Test across multiple device profiles to ensure appropriate scaling.

## 3. Implement Level of Detail (LOD) system [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create a system to manage multiple detail levels for models and effects based on distance and performance requirements
### Details:
Develop a LOD manager that handles model swapping based on distance from camera. Implement automatic LOD generation tools for artists. Create LOD transition systems to avoid popping effects. Add support for both mesh simplification and material/shader simplification at different distances. Integrate with the adaptive quality system to adjust LOD distances based on device capabilities.

## 4. Implement object pooling and occlusion culling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create systems to efficiently manage object instantiation and rendering for improved performance
### Details:
Develop a generic object pooling system for frequently created/destroyed objects (projectiles, particles, enemies). Implement occlusion culling to avoid rendering objects not visible to the camera. Create culling groups and optimize occlusion detection for different scene types. Add distance-based culling for small objects. Test in complex scenes with many objects to validate performance improvements.

## 5. Implement texture optimization and compression systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Create systems for managing texture memory usage and compression across different devices
### Details:
Implement texture compression format selection based on platform support (ASTC, BC, ETC). Create mipmap generation and management systems. Develop texture resolution scaling based on device capabilities and distance. Implement texture streaming for large environments to reduce memory usage. Add texture atlasing support for UI and small game elements. Create texture memory budget management to prevent overallocation.

## 6. Implement asset streaming and memory management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.5
### Description: Create systems for efficiently loading and unloading assets based on gameplay needs
### Details:
Develop asset streaming systems for large environments to load/unload assets based on player position. Implement asset bundling and compression for efficient loading. Create memory budgets for different asset types (textures, meshes, audio). Add asynchronous loading with prioritization. Implement asset preloading for anticipated gameplay areas. Create fallback systems for low-memory situations. Test with large environments to ensure smooth transitions between areas.
