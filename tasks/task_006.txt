# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create basic HUD and game UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the heads-up display showing critical flight information and basic game UI elements.
# Details:
Design and implement HUD elements for speed, altitude, ammo, and health. Create a targeting system with reticle and enemy indicators. Add mission objective displays. Implement a pause menu with resume, restart, and quit options. Create UI for game messages and notifications. Ensure all UI elements are responsive and scale appropriately for different screen sizes. Use CSS for styling with appropriate themes.

# Test Strategy:
Test HUD visibility and readability across different screen sizes and lighting conditions. Verify that UI elements respond correctly to game state changes. Ensure pause functionality works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core HUD elements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the primary flight information display components showing speed, altitude, ammo count, and health status
### Details:
Implement a container component for the HUD that positions elements appropriately. Create individual components for speed (numerical display with units), altitude (bar or numerical display), ammunition counter (numerical with icon), and health indicator (bar with color gradient). Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout. Ensure elements are positioned non-intrusively (typically bottom or corners of screen). Add basic animations for value changes. Test initial implementation with mock data.

## 2. Develop targeting system with reticle and enemy indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a targeting reticle in the center of the screen and directional indicators for enemies
### Details:
Implement a centered reticle that changes appearance when hovering over targetable objects. Create off-screen enemy indicators that point toward enemies outside the player's field of view (arrow indicators at screen edges). Add distance indicators for enemies. Implement visual feedback when enemy is in targeting range. Ensure targeting elements scale appropriately with screen size. Use SVG for crisp scaling of targeting elements.

## 3. Implement mission objective display and notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create UI components for displaying current mission objectives and in-game notifications
### Details:
Design a collapsible mission objective panel that shows current and completed objectives. Implement a notification system that displays temporary messages for game events (e.g., 'Mission updated', 'Low health'). Create animations for notification appearance/disappearance. Use a queue system for multiple notifications. Position objectives unobtrusively (typically top-right). Ensure text is legible across different backgrounds using appropriate contrast and optional text shadows.

## 4. Create pause menu with game options [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement a full-screen pause menu with resume, restart, and quit options
### Details:
Design a modal pause menu that appears when the player presses ESC or pause button. Include buttons for resume game, restart mission, settings, and quit game. Add appropriate hover and click animations for menu items. Implement keyboard navigation for menu options. Create a semi-transparent background that dims the game scene. Ensure menu is centered and scales appropriately for different screen sizes. Add transitions for menu appearance/disappearance.

## 5. Implement responsive design and cross-device testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Ensure all UI elements scale appropriately across different screen sizes and test on multiple devices
### Details:
Implement responsive design using CSS media queries for different screen sizes. Create breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. Test UI elements on different aspect ratios and resolutions. Adjust element sizes and positions based on screen size. Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile devices. Create a UI scaling option in settings. Verify all text remains readable at different scales. Document any device-specific considerations for future reference.
