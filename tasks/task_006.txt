# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create basic HUD and game UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the heads-up display showing critical flight information and basic game UI elements.
# Details:
Design and implement HUD elements for speed, altitude, ammo, and health. Create a targeting system with reticle and enemy indicators. Add mission objective displays. Implement a pause menu with resume, restart, and quit options. Create UI for game messages and notifications. Ensure all UI elements are responsive and scale appropriately for different screen sizes. Use CSS for styling with appropriate themes.

# Test Strategy:
Test HUD visibility and readability across different screen sizes and lighting conditions. Verify that UI elements respond correctly to game state changes. Ensure pause functionality works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core HUD elements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the primary flight information display components showing speed, altitude, ammo count, and health status
### Details:
Implement a container component for the HUD that positions elements appropriately on screen. Create individual components for speed (numeric with visual indicator), altitude (meter with numeric value), ammunition counter (visual + numeric), and health display (bar or percentage). Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout. Ensure elements are positioned non-intrusively (typically bottom/corners of screen). Add basic animations for value changes. Test initial implementation with placeholder data.

## 2. Develop targeting system with enemy indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a targeting reticle and system for highlighting/indicating enemies in the player's field of view
### Details:
Implement a centered reticle that shows when player can target/fire. Create enemy indicator markers that appear at screen edges when enemies are outside FOV. Add distance indicators for enemies. Implement visual feedback when enemy is in targeting range (reticle color change). Create a target-lock visual effect when applicable. Ensure targeting elements scale appropriately with distance. Test with different enemy positions and states.

## 3. Implement mission objectives and notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create UI components for displaying current mission objectives and in-game notifications/messages
### Details:
Design a mission objective panel that can be toggled or appears at appropriate times. Implement a notification system for game events (new objectives, warnings, achievements). Create fade-in/fade-out animations for notifications. Add a message log that can be accessed to review past notifications. Ensure objectives update visually when completed. Position these elements to avoid overlap with critical HUD components. Test with various notification types and mission states.

## 4. Create pause menu with game options [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement a full-screen pause menu with resume, restart, settings, and quit functionality
### Details:
Design a pause menu overlay that appears when game is paused. Implement menu buttons for: Resume Game, Restart Mission, Settings (submenu), and Quit Game. Add appropriate visual styling and hover effects for buttons. Create transitions for menu appearance/disappearance. Implement the settings submenu with options for audio, controls, and display settings. Ensure the pause function properly stops game activity. Test menu navigation and all button functionalities.

## 5. Implement responsive design and finalize UI integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Ensure all UI elements scale appropriately for different screen sizes and integrate the complete UI system with game state
### Details:
Implement responsive design using CSS media queries or dynamic scaling based on viewport size. Test UI on multiple screen resolutions and aspect ratios. Connect all UI elements to actual game data sources instead of placeholders. Implement UI state management to handle different game states (combat, exploration, cutscenes). Add final polish with consistent styling, colors, and themes across all UI elements. Optimize performance for UI rendering. Conduct user testing to ensure information is clearly visible and intuitive.
