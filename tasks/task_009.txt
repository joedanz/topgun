# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create environment rendering system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the system for rendering terrain, water, and sky with appropriate level of detail.
# Details:
Implement terrain rendering using heightmaps with appropriate LOD. Create water surface with reflections and animations. Design a dynamic sky system with time of day and weather effects. Add environmental objects like buildings, trees, and vehicles. Implement a fog system for distance culling and atmosphere. Create cloud rendering with volumetric or billboard techniques. Optimize rendering for performance on target devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test environment rendering performance across different devices. Verify that LOD transitions are smooth and not distracting. Ensure environmental elements look consistent and realistic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement basic terrain rendering with heightmaps [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for terrain rendering using heightmap data with basic texturing
### Details:
Implement a terrain mesh generator that takes heightmap data as input. Create a grid-based mesh with variable resolution. Apply basic texturing based on height and slope. Implement a simple shader for terrain rendering with diffuse lighting. Set up the camera and basic navigation to test the terrain.

## 2. Add Level of Detail (LOD) system to terrain [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Enhance terrain rendering with LOD to optimize performance for distant terrain
### Details:
Implement a quadtree or similar spatial partitioning structure for terrain chunks. Create multiple detail levels for terrain mesh with distance-based tessellation. Implement smooth transitions between LOD levels to prevent popping. Add frustum culling to avoid rendering terrain chunks outside the camera view. Benchmark and optimize terrain rendering performance.

## 3. Develop sky and atmospheric rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dynamic sky system with day/night cycle and atmospheric effects
### Details:
Implement a skybox or skydome with procedural coloring based on time of day. Create a sun and moon system with proper positioning based on time. Add atmospheric scattering effects for realistic sunrise/sunset. Implement a star system for night sky. Create a time controller to adjust and animate the time of day.

## 4. Implement water rendering system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Create realistic water surfaces with reflections, refractions, and animations
### Details:
Implement a water plane mesh with appropriate tessellation. Create water shaders with reflections of the sky and surrounding terrain. Add refraction effects for underwater terrain. Implement wave animations using noise functions or FFT-based approaches. Add foam effects near shorelines and for wave crests. Optimize water rendering for different quality settings.

## 5. Add environmental objects and vegetation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement system for placing and rendering buildings, trees, and other environmental objects
### Details:
Create an object placement system based on terrain properties. Implement instanced rendering for vegetation and repeated objects. Add LOD system for environmental objects based on distance. Create wind animation effects for vegetation. Implement proper shadows for environmental objects. Optimize rendering with culling techniques for dense object populations.

## 6. Develop fog and atmospheric distance effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement fog system for distance culling and atmospheric depth
### Details:
Create a distance-based fog system with height variation. Implement atmospheric perspective effects for distant terrain. Add fog density variation based on weather conditions. Create smooth transitions between different fog states. Optimize fog rendering for minimal performance impact. Integrate fog with the sky and lighting systems.

## 7. Implement cloud rendering and weather effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.6
### Description: Create a cloud system with dynamic weather patterns and effects
### Details:
Implement cloud rendering using either billboard clouds, volumetric clouds, or a hybrid approach. Create cloud movement and formation animations. Add weather effects like rain and snow with particle systems. Implement lightning effects for storm conditions. Create transitions between different weather states. Optimize cloud rendering for performance with appropriate LOD techniques.
