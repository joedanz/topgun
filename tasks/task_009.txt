# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create environment rendering system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the system for rendering terrain, water, and sky with appropriate level of detail.
# Details:
Implement terrain rendering using heightmaps with appropriate LOD. Create water surface with reflections and animations. Design a dynamic sky system with time of day and weather effects. Add environmental objects like buildings, trees, and vehicles. Implement a fog system for distance culling and atmosphere. Create cloud rendering with volumetric or billboard techniques. Optimize rendering for performance on target devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test environment rendering performance across different devices. Verify that LOD transitions are smooth and not distracting. Ensure environmental elements look consistent and realistic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement terrain rendering with heightmap-based LOD [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for terrain rendering using heightmaps with multiple levels of detail
### Details:
Implement a terrain system using heightmap data to generate mesh geometry. Create a quadtree or similar structure for LOD management. Implement mesh tessellation based on camera distance. Support texture splatting for different terrain types (grass, rock, sand, etc.). Include normal mapping for surface detail. Ensure smooth transitions between LOD levels to prevent popping.

## 2. Develop water surface rendering system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create realistic water surfaces with reflections, refractions, and animations
### Details:
Implement planar water surfaces using specialized shaders. Add screen-space reflections of the environment. Implement normal mapping for wave details and animation. Create foam effects near shorelines and object intersections. Add underwater caustics. Implement water transparency with depth-based color adjustment. Ensure proper integration with the terrain system for shoreline blending.

## 3. Create dynamic sky and lighting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop a sky rendering system with time of day cycle and atmospheric effects
### Details:
Implement a sky dome or box with procedural texturing. Create a day/night cycle with sun and moon positioning. Add a dynamic lighting system that affects terrain and water. Implement atmospheric scattering for realistic sky colors at different times. Add a star system for night sky. Create smooth transitions between different times of day. Ensure the lighting system properly affects all other environment elements.

## 4. Implement weather and cloud systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Add dynamic weather effects and cloud rendering to the environment
### Details:
Develop a volumetric or billboard-based cloud system. Implement cloud movement and formation algorithms. Create precipitation effects (rain, snow). Add lightning and thunder for storm conditions. Implement weather transitions with appropriate visual and lighting changes. Ensure clouds cast shadows on the terrain. Create a weather parameter system that can be controlled programmatically.

## 5. Add environmental objects and vegetation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Integrate static and dynamic environmental objects into the rendering system
### Details:
Implement a system for placing buildings, trees, rocks, and other objects on the terrain. Create LOD systems for environmental objects. Add vegetation with wind animation effects. Implement instancing for efficient rendering of repeated objects. Create a procedural placement system based on terrain properties. Ensure proper shadowing and lighting integration with the sky system. Add collision data for gameplay interactions.

## 6. Develop atmospheric fog and distance effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create fog and atmospheric effects for depth perception and distance culling
### Details:
Implement distance-based fog with height variation. Create atmospheric haze effects that change with weather and time of day. Add distance culling to improve performance. Implement heat distortion effects for appropriate environments. Create depth-based color grading for distance objects. Ensure fog interacts properly with all environment elements. Add particle systems for localized atmospheric effects (dust, mist).

## 7. Optimize rendering pipeline for performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6
### Description: Refine and optimize the entire environment rendering system for target hardware
### Details:
Implement occlusion culling to avoid rendering hidden objects. Add frustum culling for off-screen elements. Optimize shader complexity based on distance and importance. Create render buckets for efficient batching. Implement texture streaming for large environments. Add quality settings for different hardware capabilities. Profile and optimize CPU/GPU bottlenecks. Implement level streaming for large environments. Create a debug visualization system for performance monitoring.
