# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop aircraft selection and progression system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for unlocking and selecting different aircraft with progression tracking.
# Details:
Design a progression system with XP and unlocks. Create an aircraft selection UI with details and statistics. Implement persistent storage for player progress using LocalStorage. Add aircraft categories (fighters, bombers, helicopters) with different capabilities. Create a system for displaying aircraft specifications and comparisons. Implement prerequisites for aircraft unlocks based on player achievements. Add visual indicators for locked and available aircraft.

# Test Strategy:
Test progression tracking across game sessions. Verify that aircraft unlock correctly based on XP. Ensure the selection UI displays accurate information and is intuitive to use.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement player progression data model and storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core data structures for tracking player progression, XP, and aircraft unlock status with LocalStorage persistence
### Details:
Design and implement a data model that tracks: player XP/level, unlocked aircraft IDs, achievement progress, and other progression metrics. Create functions to load/save this data to LocalStorage. Include methods for updating XP, checking unlock requirements, and persisting changes. Implement error handling for storage failures and data validation to prevent corruption. This foundation will support all other progression features.

## 2. Create aircraft data model with categories and specifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop the data structure for all aircraft including their categories, stats, and unlock requirements
### Details:
Define a comprehensive aircraft data model with properties for: unique ID, name, category (fighter/bomber/helicopter), specifications (speed, armor, weapons, etc.), unlock requirements (XP level, achievements, prerequisites), visual assets paths, and description text. Implement aircraft categories as an enum or similar structure. Create a central registry of all available aircraft with their complete specifications. Include helper methods to filter aircraft by category, check unlock status against player progression data, and compare aircraft statistics.

## 3. Implement aircraft unlock and progression mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create the game logic for earning XP, unlocking aircraft, and tracking achievement-based prerequisites
### Details:
Implement functions to award XP for various player actions. Create the logic to determine when aircraft unlock requirements are met based on player level, completed achievements, or other prerequisites. Develop a notification system to alert players when new aircraft become available. Add methods to track achievement progress specifically related to aircraft unlocks. Ensure all progression changes update the persistent storage implemented in subtask 1.

## 4. Develop aircraft selection UI with filtering and comparison [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Create the user interface for browsing, comparing and selecting aircraft
### Details:
Design and implement a UI that displays aircraft organized by categories. Include filtering options to show all/available/locked aircraft. Create detailed aircraft cards showing specifications and unlock requirements. Implement a comparison view to evaluate stats between multiple aircraft. Add visual indicators (icons/overlays) for locked aircraft and newly unlocked ones. Ensure the UI reflects real-time changes to unlock status. Include selection confirmation and 'set as active' functionality to choose the current aircraft.

## 5. Integrate aircraft selection with game systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Connect the aircraft selection and progression system with the main game mechanics
### Details:
Implement the logic to load the selected aircraft when starting gameplay. Create hooks for gameplay events to trigger XP gains and achievement progress. Add UI elements to display current progression status during gameplay (XP bar, level indicator). Ensure aircraft-specific capabilities affect gameplay appropriately (different handling for fighters vs. helicopters). Add a quick-select option for changing aircraft between gameplay sessions. Test the complete progression loop from earning XP to unlocking and using new aircraft.
