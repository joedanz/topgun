# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop aircraft selection and progression system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for unlocking and selecting different aircraft with progression tracking.
# Details:
Design a progression system with XP and unlocks. Create an aircraft selection UI with details and statistics. Implement persistent storage for player progress using LocalStorage. Add aircraft categories (fighters, bombers, helicopters) with different capabilities. Create a system for displaying aircraft specifications and comparisons. Implement prerequisites for aircraft unlocks based on player achievements. Add visual indicators for locked and available aircraft.

# Test Strategy:
Test progression tracking across game sessions. Verify that aircraft unlock correctly based on XP. Ensure the selection UI displays accurate information and is intuitive to use.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement aircraft data model and storage system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data structures for aircraft and player progression tracking with persistent storage
### Details:
Define a comprehensive aircraft data model with properties including: id, name, category (fighter/bomber/helicopter), specifications (speed, armor, weapons, maneuverability), unlock requirements (XP level, prerequisites), and visual assets. Implement the LocalStorage persistence layer to save and load player progression data including: XP, unlocked aircraft, and achievements. Create utility functions for data access, updates, and synchronization between memory and storage.

## 2. Develop XP and progression tracking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create the core progression mechanics that track player XP and determine aircraft unlock status
### Details:
Implement an XP system with leveling mechanics (XP thresholds for each level). Create functions to award XP for various player achievements. Develop the unlock validation logic that checks if a player meets requirements for specific aircraft (based on XP level, completed achievements, and prerequisite aircraft). Add event listeners for progression-related events and ensure all progression changes persist to storage. Include methods to query unlock status for any aircraft.

## 3. Create aircraft selection UI framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Build the base UI components for the aircraft selection screen with navigation between categories
### Details:
Design and implement the main aircraft selection screen with tabs for different categories (fighters, bombers, helicopters). Create the grid/list view of aircraft with placeholder slots for each aircraft. Implement navigation controls between categories and aircraft. Add visual states for aircraft (locked, available, selected) with appropriate styling. Ensure the UI is responsive and works across different screen sizes. At this stage, focus on structure and navigation without detailed aircraft information panels.

## 4. Implement detailed aircraft information display [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Add detailed aircraft specification panels and comparison functionality to the selection UI
### Details:
Create detailed information panels that display when an aircraft is selected, showing all specifications and unlock requirements. Implement visual charts/graphs for aircraft statistics (radar charts for comparing attributes). Add a comparison mode allowing players to view stats of two aircraft side by side. Include visual indicators for strengths/weaknesses compared to currently selected aircraft. For locked aircraft, clearly display the requirements needed to unlock them with progress indicators where applicable.

## 5. Connect progression system to UI and implement selection functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.4
### Description: Integrate the progression system with the UI and implement aircraft selection with feedback
### Details:
Connect the progression tracking system to the UI to dynamically update aircraft availability. Implement the selection and confirmation flow when a player chooses an aircraft. Add visual and audio feedback for important events (unlocking new aircraft, selecting aircraft). Create notification indicators for newly unlocked aircraft. Implement tutorial elements to guide new players through the progression system. Perform comprehensive testing across the entire system to ensure proper persistence, unlock logic, and UI state management.
