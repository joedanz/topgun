# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement weapons and combat mechanics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the weapons systems, projectile physics, and hit detection for air combat.
# Details:
Design a modular weapon system supporting different weapon types (machine guns, missiles). Implement projectile physics with appropriate trajectories and speeds. Create hit detection using raycasting and collision detection. Add visual and audio feedback for firing and hits. Implement damage calculation based on hit location and weapon type. Create weapon cooldown and ammo management systems. Add special weapons like guided missiles with appropriate tracking logic.

# Test Strategy:
Test weapon firing and hit detection accuracy. Verify that projectile physics behave realistically. Ensure damage calculation works correctly and consistently.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create base weapon system architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core weapon system architecture with interfaces and base classes
### Details:
Create a modular weapon system architecture with interfaces and abstract classes. Define the IWeapon interface with methods like Fire(), Reload(), and properties like ammoCount, cooldownTime, and damageAmount. Implement a BaseWeapon abstract class that handles common functionality. Create data structures for weapon configurations and stats. This foundation will support different weapon types in subsequent tasks.

## 2. Implement projectile physics system [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a physics system for different projectile types with appropriate trajectories
### Details:
Develop a projectile physics system that handles different projectile behaviors. Implement ballistic trajectories for bullets with gravity influence, straight-line paths for machine guns, and guided paths for missiles. Create a ProjectileManager to handle instantiation, pooling, and lifecycle management. Implement velocity, acceleration, and drag calculations. Ensure the system can be configured for different projectile speeds, masses, and flight characteristics.

## 3. Implement hit detection and collision system [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create the hit detection system using raycasting and collision detection
### Details:
Implement hit detection using a combination of raycasting for instant-hit weapons and colliders for physical projectiles. Create a HitDetectionManager that handles different detection methods. Implement collision layers to properly filter relevant collisions. Add hit information data structures to store impact point, normal, and hit object. For high-speed projectiles, implement continuous collision detection to prevent tunneling through thin objects. Test with various scenarios including moving targets.

## 4. Develop specific weapon types [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement concrete weapon classes for machine guns, missiles, and other weapon types
### Details:
Create concrete implementations of different weapon types inheriting from BaseWeapon: MachineGun (high fire rate, low damage), Cannon (low fire rate, high damage), Missile (guided, explosive damage), and RocketPod (multiple unguided rockets). Implement weapon-specific behaviors like spread patterns for machine guns, lock-on mechanics for guided missiles, and area damage for explosive weapons. Configure appropriate projectile types, fire rates, damage values, and ammo capacities for each weapon.

## 5. Implement damage system and feedback effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create the damage calculation system and visual/audio feedback for combat
### Details:
Implement a damage system that calculates final damage based on weapon type, hit location (critical hits), distance, and target armor. Create visual effects for weapon firing (muzzle flashes, smoke), projectile trails, and impacts (explosions, sparks, debris). Add audio feedback for firing, flying projectiles, and impacts. Implement screen shake and controller vibration for player feedback. Create a hit marker system to indicate successful hits to the player.

## 6. Implement weapon management and special weapons [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Create weapon cooldown, ammo management, and special weapon systems
### Details:
Implement weapon cooldown timers and heat management for continuous fire weapons. Create an ammo management system with different ammo types, reloading mechanics, and ammo displays. Implement weapon switching logic and UI. Add special weapons like guided missiles with target tracking, lock-on mechanics, and countermeasure vulnerability. Implement weapon loadout configurations and selection UI. Add weapon upgrades and modifications system to allow for player customization.
