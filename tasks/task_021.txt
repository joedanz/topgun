# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (Rubber-Banding) System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a RubberBandManager that dynamically adjusts AI parameters based on player performance metrics to maintain an optimal challenge level throughout gameplay.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive RubberBandManager class that interfaces with the PlayerPerformanceTracker to adjust difficulty in real-time:

1. Core Functionality:
   - Create a system that monitors performance metrics (K/D ratio, accuracy, damage stats)
   - Implement smooth parameter transitions using interpolation (linear, ease-in/out)
   - Define difficulty bands with min/max thresholds for each AI parameter
   - Support both individual AI adjustments and global difficulty scaling

2. Implementation Requirements:
   - Create configurable adjustment curves for different parameters (reaction time, accuracy, aggression)
   - Implement hysteresis to prevent rapid oscillation between difficulty levels
   - Add cooldown periods between major adjustments to make changes less noticeable
   - Create a parameter clamping system to ensure AI never exceeds fair limits

3. Integration Points:
   - Hook into the PlayerPerformanceTracker's events/callbacks
   - Modify EnemyAIController parameters at runtime
   - Update FormationManager behavior based on current difficulty level
   - Add user settings for enabling/disabling rubber-banding features

4. Debug Features:
   - Implement comprehensive logging of all parameter adjustments
   - Create a debug overlay showing current difficulty level and recent adjustments
   - Add developer console commands to manually trigger difficulty changes

The system should feel fair and natural, avoiding obvious "catch-up" mechanics that frustrate players.

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Testing:
   - Unit tests for parameter interpolation functions
   - Integration tests verifying RubberBandManager correctly responds to PlayerPerformanceTracker events
   - Stress tests with extreme performance values to verify parameter clamping

2. Simulation Testing:
   - Create automated bots that simulate different skill levels (novice, intermediate, expert)
   - Run extended simulations to verify difficulty converges appropriately for each skill level
   - Test rapid performance changes to ensure system responds appropriately without oscillation

3. Playtest Validation:
   - Blind A/B testing with and without rubber-banding enabled
   - Collect subjective feedback on perceived difficulty and fairness
   - Record metrics on player engagement and session length with different settings

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Verify behavior during unusual gameplay (player AFK, extremely high/low performance)
   - Test with different game modes and mission types
   - Ensure system gracefully handles interrupted gameplay sessions

Document all test results with quantitative metrics showing the system maintains an appropriate challenge level across different player skill levels.
