# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement client-side multiplayer integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate multiplayer capabilities into the game client with appropriate synchronization.
# Details:
Create client-side networking code to connect to the WebSocket server. Implement entity interpolation for smooth movement of remote players. Add prediction and reconciliation for local player actions. Create a lobby system for joining and creating games. Implement chat functionality for player communication. Add friend invites and social features. Create multiplayer-specific UI elements like scoreboards and player lists. Implement spectator mode for observing games.

# Test Strategy:
Test multiplayer synchronization with various network conditions. Verify that entity interpolation produces smooth gameplay. Ensure that the lobby system functions correctly for matchmaking.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement WebSocket connection and basic networking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the client-side networking foundation to establish and maintain connection with the multiplayer server
### Details:
Implement a NetworkManager class that handles WebSocket connection establishment, reconnection logic, message serialization/deserialization, and basic error handling. Create a message protocol for client-server communication with message types for connection, disconnection, and heartbeat. Add connection status indicators in the UI and implement connection timeout handling.

## 2. Develop lobby and matchmaking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create UI and functionality for players to create, join, and manage multiplayer game sessions
### Details:
Implement a LobbyManager class to handle game room creation, joining rooms via room codes, and matchmaking requests. Create lobby UI screens including room creation form, room browser, and waiting room. Add functionality for room settings configuration (private/public, max players, game mode). Implement ready-up mechanism and countdown timer for game start when all players are ready.

## 3. Implement entity synchronization and interpolation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create system for smooth representation of remote player movements and actions
### Details:
Develop an EntitySynchronizer class that receives position/rotation updates from the server and applies them to remote player entities. Implement interpolation algorithm to smooth movement between network updates. Create buffer system for handling out-of-order packets. Add visual indicators for connection quality issues. Implement optimization for update frequency based on entity distance and importance.

## 4. Implement client-side prediction and reconciliation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create system for responsive local player movement with server authority
### Details:
Implement input prediction system that applies player inputs locally before server confirmation. Create input buffer that stores recent inputs with timestamps. Develop reconciliation system that corrects client state when server corrections are received. Add configurable prediction parameters based on connection quality. Implement visual debugging tools to show prediction errors when they occur.

## 5. Create in-game chat and communication system [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Implement text and potentially voice chat functionality for player communication
### Details:
Create ChatManager class to handle sending/receiving chat messages. Implement UI for chat input, chat history with timestamps and player names. Add support for team-only and global chat channels. Implement chat notifications and unread message indicators. Add basic moderation features like muting players. Create emoji/reaction support for quick communication.

## 6. Implement multiplayer UI elements and scoreboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Create UI components specific to multiplayer gameplay
### Details:
Develop a ScoreboardManager to track and display player statistics. Create UI for real-time scoreboard showing player names, scores, ping, and other relevant stats. Implement end-of-match results screen with detailed statistics. Add player nameplates above characters with health/status indicators. Create team indicators and objective markers for team-based game modes.

## 7. Implement spectator mode and social features [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3, 15.6
### Description: Add functionality for observing games and social interaction between players
### Details:
Create SpectatorManager to handle spectator-specific view modes and camera controls. Implement friend invite system integrated with the lobby. Add spectator UI showing game state and player information. Create camera modes for spectating (follow player, free camera, etc). Implement replay system for watching key moments. Add social features like friend lists, recent players, and blocking functionality.
