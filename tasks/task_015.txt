# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement client-side multiplayer integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate multiplayer capabilities into the game client with appropriate synchronization.
# Details:
Create client-side networking code to connect to the WebSocket server. Implement entity interpolation for smooth movement of remote players. Add prediction and reconciliation for local player actions. Create a lobby system for joining and creating games. Implement chat functionality for player communication. Add friend invites and social features. Create multiplayer-specific UI elements like scoreboards and player lists. Implement spectator mode for observing games.

# Test Strategy:
Test multiplayer synchronization with various network conditions. Verify that entity interpolation produces smooth gameplay. Ensure that the lobby system functions correctly for matchmaking.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement WebSocket connection and basic networking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the client-side networking foundation to establish and maintain connection with the multiplayer server
### Details:
Implement a NetworkManager class that handles WebSocket connection establishment, reconnection logic, message serialization/deserialization, and basic error handling. Create a message protocol for client-server communication with message types for connection, disconnection, and heartbeat. Add connection status indicators in the UI and implement connection retry mechanisms.

## 2. Develop lobby system and game session management [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create UI and logic for players to browse, create, and join multiplayer game sessions
### Details:
Implement a LobbyManager class to handle available games list, game creation with configurable settings, and joining existing games. Create lobby UI screens including game browser, creation form, and waiting room. Add session state synchronization to show real-time updates of players joining/leaving. Implement game start coordination and transition from lobby to gameplay.

## 3. Implement entity synchronization and remote player rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create systems to receive and display other players' states in the game world
### Details:
Develop an EntitySynchronizer that processes incoming network messages about remote player positions, rotations, and states. Implement entity interpolation for smooth movement between network updates. Create visual representations for remote players with appropriate animations based on their actions. Add player identification elements like usernames and avatars above characters.

## 4. Implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create a responsive local player experience with prediction and correction based on server authority
### Details:
Implement client-side prediction to immediately apply local player inputs while sending them to the server. Create a command history buffer to store recent inputs. Develop reconciliation logic to handle server corrections by replaying inputs when server state differs from predicted state. Add visual indicators for high latency or desynchronization issues.

## 5. Add in-game chat and communication features [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement text-based communication between players during gameplay and in lobbies
### Details:
Create a ChatManager class to handle sending and receiving chat messages. Implement UI components for chat input, message history, and notification of new messages. Add support for different chat channels (global, team, private). Implement basic moderation features like message filtering. Create visual and audio notifications for incoming messages.

## 6. Implement multiplayer UI elements and scoreboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create UI components specific to multiplayer gameplay for player status and game progress
### Details:
Develop a ScoreboardManager to track and display player statistics. Create UI for in-game player list showing connected players, their status, scores, and ping. Implement end-of-match summary screens with performance statistics. Add team-based UI elements if applicable (team scores, team member status). Create notifications for game events like players joining/leaving.

## 7. Implement spectator mode and social features [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.6
### Description: Add functionality for players to observe games and interact socially with friends
### Details:
Create a SpectatorManager to handle spectator-specific view logic and limitations. Implement camera controls for spectators to follow specific players or free-roam. Add friend system integration with invite functionality. Implement spectator chat with appropriate permissions. Create UI for spectator count and management. Add social features like adding friends from recent players list.
