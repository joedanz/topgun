# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment System with Player Performance Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive system that monitors player performance metrics and dynamically adjusts AI difficulty in real-time to provide appropriate challenge levels based on player skill.
# Details:
Develop a PlayerPerformanceTracker module that collects and analyzes key player metrics including accuracy, kill/death ratio, damage dealt/received, time spent in different states (attacking, defending, etc.), and streak data. The tracker should maintain both short-term (last 2-5 minutes) and long-term (entire session) statistics.

Implement a DifficultyManager that consumes these metrics and applies a rubber-banding algorithm to adjust AI parameters. This should include:
- Defining clear thresholds for when difficulty adjustments trigger
- Creating smooth transition curves between difficulty levels
- Adjusting appropriate AI parameters (reaction time, accuracy, aggression, tactics selection)
- Ensuring AI never exceeds player-equivalent constraints (no superhuman abilities)
- Adding safeguards to prevent frustrating difficulty spikes

Extend the EnemyAIStates and FormationManager to support advanced tactical behaviors that can be enabled/disabled based on current difficulty level, including:
- Flanking maneuvers
- Ambush tactics
- Strategic retreats
- Coordinated group behaviors
- Adaptive evasion

Implement optional UI indicators that subtly inform players when difficulty changes occur. Add configuration options to allow players to disable dynamic difficulty in favor of fixed difficulty levels.

Create comprehensive debug tools including:
- Visual overlays showing current difficulty level
- Logging of major difficulty adjustments
- Real-time display of player performance metrics being tracked
- Toggle switches for enabling/disabling specific aspects of the system

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical implementation and player experience:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Verify PlayerPerformanceTracker correctly calculates all metrics
   - Confirm DifficultyManager applies appropriate adjustments based on input metrics
   - Test boundary conditions (extremely high/low player performance)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Simulate various player skill profiles using automated test scripts
   - Verify AI behavior appropriately scales up/down based on performance
   - Ensure smooth transitions between difficulty levels

3. Playtest Scenarios:
   - Test with deliberately poor play to verify AI becomes less challenging
   - Test with expert play to verify AI becomes more challenging
   - Verify the system recovers appropriately after player performance changes dramatically

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure CPU/memory impact of the tracking and adjustment systems
   - Ensure no noticeable performance degradation during gameplay

5. A/B Testing:
   - Compare player engagement metrics between fixed difficulty and dynamic difficulty
   - Collect qualitative feedback on perceived fairness and enjoyment

Document all test results with specific metrics and observations about AI behavior changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement PlayerPerformanceTracker Core Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive data collection system that tracks and stores player performance metrics in both short-term (2-5 minutes) and long-term (entire session) timeframes.
### Details:
Implement using the Observer pattern to monitor player actions in real-time. Create a PlayerMetrics class that tracks: accuracy, kill/death ratio, damage dealt/received, time spent in different states (attacking, defending), and streak data. Use a circular buffer for short-term metrics and persistent storage for long-term data. Implement weighted averaging to prevent outliers from skewing results. Add methods for calculating derived metrics (e.g., combat efficiency score). Include timestamp data with all metrics to enable time-series analysis. Use ScriptableObjects for configuration parameters to allow easy tuning.

## 2. Develop Performance Analysis and Profiling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Create an analysis system that processes raw player metrics into actionable difficulty adjustment signals, including player skill assessment and engagement detection.
### Details:
Implement statistical analysis methods to identify player skill level and trends. Create a PlayerProfile class that maintains a model of player capabilities across different gameplay dimensions. Use moving averages with configurable time windows to detect improvement or decline in performance. Implement engagement detection based on play patterns (e.g., aggressive vs. cautious). Add threshold detection for significant performance changes that should trigger difficulty adjustments. Use the Strategy pattern to allow different analysis algorithms to be swapped or combined. Include methods to detect player frustration signals (repeated deaths in same area, declining accuracy over time).

## 3. Build DifficultyManager with PID Controller [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Implement a DifficultyManager that uses a PID controller to smoothly adjust game difficulty based on player performance metrics.
### Details:
Implement a PID controller as recommended in the research to provide smooth, gradual difficulty transitions. Define clear thresholds for when difficulty adjustments trigger based on performance analysis. Create transition curves between difficulty levels using easing functions to avoid jarring changes. Implement a DifficultyState class using the State pattern to represent different difficulty levels. Add hysteresis to prevent rapid oscillation between difficulty states. Include configuration options for PID parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) and setpoint (target player success rate). Implement safeguards to prevent extreme difficulty spikes by limiting the maximum rate of change.

## 4. Implement AI Parameter Adjustment System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Create a system that translates difficulty levels into specific AI behavior parameter adjustments while ensuring AI never exceeds player-equivalent constraints.
### Details:
Implement parameter adjustment for: reaction time, accuracy, aggression level, and tactical decision making. Create an AIParameterProfile class for each difficulty level with appropriate constraints. Ensure parameters scale proportionally to maintain balanced AI behavior. Add randomization within appropriate bounds to prevent predictable AI. Implement hard caps on AI capabilities to prevent superhuman abilities (e.g., perfect accuracy, instant reactions). Use the Strategy pattern to allow different adjustment strategies for different enemy types. Create smooth interpolation between parameter sets when transitioning between difficulty levels.

## 5. Extend EnemyAIStates with Advanced Tactical Behaviors [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.4
### Description: Enhance the AI system with advanced tactical behaviors that can be enabled or disabled based on current difficulty level.
### Details:
Implement flanking maneuvers using pathfinding with tactical waypoints. Create ambush tactics that consider player movement patterns and map chokepoints. Add strategic retreat behaviors when AI health is low or when outmatched. Implement coordinated group behaviors using a shared knowledge base between AI units. Develop adaptive evasion tactics that respond to player attack patterns. Use the State pattern for different tactical states. Ensure each behavior has difficulty-dependent parameters that control its effectiveness and frequency. Create a TacticalDecisionMaker class that selects appropriate tactics based on current situation and difficulty level.

## 6. Implement FormationManager with Difficulty-Based Coordination [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.5
### Description: Extend the FormationManager to support group AI behaviors that adapt based on current difficulty level and player performance.
### Details:
Implement formation types (pincer, flanking, defensive) that unlock at appropriate difficulty levels. Create a coordination system allowing AI units to communicate intentions and coordinate attacks. Add difficulty-based formation selection logic that chooses more sophisticated formations at higher difficulty. Implement dynamic role assignment within formations based on unit types and current tactical situation. Create smooth transitions between formations to avoid obvious AI state changes. Add leader/follower relationships within groups with leader AI receiving difficulty boosts. Implement formation disruption detection and recovery strategies.

## 7. Create Subtle UI Feedback and Player Configuration Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Implement subtle UI indicators for difficulty changes and add configuration options allowing players to customize or disable the dynamic difficulty system.
### Details:
Create subtle visual/audio cues that indicate difficulty transitions without breaking immersion (e.g., music tempo changes, lighting adjustments). Implement a settings menu with options to: enable/disable DDA entirely, set preferred baseline difficulty, adjust sensitivity of the system. Add an optional difficulty indicator that can be enabled in settings. Create a notification system for significant difficulty changes that uses the game's existing UI framework. Implement player preference persistence between game sessions. Add tooltips and help text explaining the DDA system to players who want to understand it.
