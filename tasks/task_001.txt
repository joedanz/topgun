# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and build system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with necessary directories, configuration files, and build system to support development across platforms.
# Details:
Create a modular project structure with separate directories for models, textures, audio, and code. Set up Webpack or Rollup for bundling with appropriate loaders for assets. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Create development and production build configurations with appropriate optimizations. Set up a local development server with hot reloading.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the build system correctly bundles all assets and code. Test that the development server runs properly on both desktop and mobile browsers. Ensure that ESLint and Prettier are functioning correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic directory structure and initialize project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational project structure with all necessary directories and initialize the project with package.json
### Details:
Create the root project directory and initialize with npm/yarn. Create the following directory structure: src/ (with subdirectories for models/, textures/, audio/, and code/), public/, dist/, and config/. Initialize package.json with appropriate metadata, scripts section, and initial dependencies. Add README.md with project overview and setup instructions. Create .gitignore file with appropriate entries for node_modules, build artifacts, and environment files.

## 2. Configure bundler and asset loaders [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Webpack or Rollup with appropriate configuration for bundling JavaScript and handling various asset types
### Details:
Choose between Webpack or Rollup based on project needs. Install the bundler and required dependencies. Create configuration file (webpack.config.js or rollup.config.js) in the config/ directory. Configure entry points and output settings. Set up loaders/plugins for different asset types: file-loader for images and models, css-loader and style-loader for styles, and appropriate loaders for audio files. Configure asset optimization for production builds. Set up source maps for development.

## 3. Implement code quality tools [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style and quality enforcement
### Details:
Install ESLint, Prettier, and related plugins as dev dependencies. Create configuration files (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc) with appropriate rules. Set up integration between ESLint and Prettier to avoid conflicts. Add lint and format scripts to package.json. Configure editor integration recommendations (e.g., .vscode/settings.json for VS Code users). Create a pre-commit hook using husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality on commits.

## 4. Create development and production build configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement separate build configurations for development and production environments with appropriate optimizations
### Details:
Create separate configuration files for development and production environments. For development: enable hot module replacement, use eval-source-map for better debugging, and disable minification. For production: enable code splitting, configure minification and tree shaking, optimize assets (image compression, etc.), and generate source maps. Set up environment variables handling with dotenv or similar. Add build scripts to package.json for both environments. Implement a common configuration file to share settings between environments.

## 5. Set up local development server with hot reloading [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Configure a development server with live reloading capabilities for efficient development workflow
### Details:
Install development server dependencies (webpack-dev-server for Webpack or serve with rollup-plugin-livereload for Rollup). Configure the development server in the appropriate config file with settings for port, host, and content base. Enable hot module replacement for instant updates without full page reloads. Set up proxy configuration for API requests if needed. Configure automatic opening of browser on server start. Add dev server start script to package.json. Test the complete development workflow to ensure all components work together properly.
