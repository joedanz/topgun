# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and build system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with necessary directories, configuration files, and build system to support development across platforms.
# Details:
Create a modular project structure with separate directories for models, textures, audio, and code. Set up Webpack or Rollup for bundling with appropriate loaders for assets. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Create development and production build configurations with appropriate optimizations. Set up a local development server with hot reloading.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the build system correctly bundles all assets and code. Test that the development server runs properly on both desktop and mobile browsers. Ensure that ESLint and Prettier are functioning correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic project directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the project repository and establish the core directory structure for organizing code and assets
### Details:
Create the following directory structure: src/ (for source code), src/models/ (for 3D models), src/textures/ (for image assets), src/audio/ (for sound files), src/components/ (for reusable UI components), src/utils/ (for helper functions), public/ (for static assets), and dist/ (for build output). Initialize git repository with appropriate .gitignore file. Create placeholder README.md with project overview and setup instructions.

## 2. Initialize package.json and install core dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up Node.js project configuration and install essential development dependencies
### Details:
Run 'npm init' to create package.json with project metadata. Install core dependencies: webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server for bundling; babel-loader, @babel/core, @babel/preset-env for transpilation; file-loader, url-loader, css-loader, style-loader for asset handling; html-webpack-plugin for HTML generation. Create initial package.json scripts for 'start', 'build:dev', and 'build:prod' commands.

## 3. Configure Webpack for development and production [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create Webpack configuration files for different environments with appropriate optimizations
### Details:
Create webpack.common.js with shared configuration. Create webpack.dev.js with development-specific settings (source maps, dev server config, hot module replacement). Create webpack.prod.js with production optimizations (minification, code splitting, asset optimization). Implement entry points, output configuration, and module rules for processing different file types. Configure HTML template generation and asset handling.

## 4. Set up code quality tools (ESLint and Prettier) [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure linting and code formatting tools to ensure code quality and consistency
### Details:
Install ESLint, Prettier, and related plugins (eslint-config-prettier, eslint-plugin-prettier). Create .eslintrc.js with appropriate rules for the project. Create .prettierrc with formatting preferences. Add lint scripts to package.json ('lint', 'lint:fix'). Configure editor integration via .vscode/settings.json (if using VS Code). Add pre-commit hooks using husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality on commits.

## 5. Set up development server with hot reloading [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Configure and test the local development environment with live reloading capabilities
### Details:
Configure webpack-dev-server in webpack.dev.js with appropriate settings (port, host, historyApiFallback, etc.). Implement hot module replacement for supported file types. Create a minimal index.html template and index.js entry point to test the setup. Add npm scripts for starting the development server. Document the development workflow in README.md, including how to start the server, access the application, and use hot reloading features.
