# Task ID: 18
# Title: Develop advanced mission types and objectives
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create specialized mission types like ground strikes, escorts, and refueling challenges.
# Details:
Implement ground strike missions with targetable ground units. Create escort missions with ally protection objectives. Design refueling challenges requiring precision flying. Implement time trial missions with checkpoints. Add specialized mission mechanics like stealth or reconnaissance. Create mission-specific environmental conditions (night, storms). Implement dynamic mission generation for replayability.

# Test Strategy:
Test each mission type to ensure objectives function correctly. Verify that specialized mechanics work as intended. Ensure mission difficulty is appropriate and balanced.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ground strike mission framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for ground strike missions with targetable ground units and basic objective tracking
### Details:
Develop a system for placing and managing destructible ground targets (buildings, vehicles, installations). Implement target health systems, damage models, and destruction effects. Create objective tracking to monitor target destruction progress. Add mission success/failure conditions based on percentage of targets destroyed. Include different target types with varying difficulty (stationary vs. mobile, armored vs. unarmored).

## 2. Develop escort mission mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create escort missions where players must protect allied aircraft or ground units
### Details:
Implement AI for allied units that need protection. Create threat systems that target these allies. Develop proximity-based protection mechanics that track player position relative to allies. Implement health/damage tracking for escorted units. Add mission failure conditions when allies are destroyed. Include progress indicators showing escort route completion percentage and ally health status.

## 3. Create aerial refueling challenge system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement precision flying challenges requiring players to refuel mid-air
### Details:
Model tanker aircraft with accurate flight patterns and refueling equipment. Implement docking mechanics for refueling probe/receptacle. Create precision flying requirements with appropriate collision detection. Add fuel transfer systems that track successful connection time. Implement visual and audio feedback for successful/unsuccessful refueling attempts. Include difficulty levels with varying tanker speeds and weather conditions.

## 4. Implement time trial mission system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop checkpoint-based time trial missions with timing and scoring mechanics
### Details:
Create a checkpoint system with visible markers in 3D space. Implement timing mechanics to track mission progress. Develop a scoring system based on completion time and optional objectives. Add checkpoint sequencing with directional indicators. Create leaderboard integration for comparing times. Include multiple difficulty levels with more complex checkpoint patterns and tighter time requirements.

## 5. Add specialized mission mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.4
### Description: Implement stealth, reconnaissance, and other specialized mission objectives
### Details:
Develop stealth mechanics with detection systems based on altitude, speed, and noise. Create reconnaissance objectives requiring photography or scanning of specific targets. Implement data collection mechanics for intelligence-gathering missions. Add enemy radar and detection systems with visual indicators for threat zones. Create mission-specific UI elements showing stealth status and reconnaissance progress. Include specialized equipment options relevant to mission types.

## 6. Create dynamic mission generation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Implement a system for procedurally generating missions with variable conditions and objectives
### Details:
Develop a mission template system that can be populated with different objectives. Create environmental condition variations (time of day, weather, visibility). Implement difficulty scaling based on player progression. Add mission randomization for target placement, enemy composition, and objective combinations. Create a mission selection interface showing available mission types and conditions. Implement a reward system based on mission complexity and performance.
