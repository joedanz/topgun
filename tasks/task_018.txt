# Task ID: 18
# Title: Develop advanced mission types and objectives
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create specialized mission types like ground strikes, escorts, and refueling challenges.
# Details:
Implement ground strike missions with targetable ground units. Create escort missions with ally protection objectives. Design refueling challenges requiring precision flying. Implement time trial missions with checkpoints. Add specialized mission mechanics like stealth or reconnaissance. Create mission-specific environmental conditions (night, storms). Implement dynamic mission generation for replayability.

# Test Strategy:
Test each mission type to ensure objectives function correctly. Verify that specialized mechanics work as intended. Ensure mission difficulty is appropriate and balanced.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ground strike mission framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for ground strike missions with targetable ground units and basic objective tracking
### Details:
Develop a system for spawning and managing ground targets (military bases, vehicles, installations). Implement target health systems and destruction effects. Create objective tracking for destroying specific targets or a percentage of targets. Add mission success/failure conditions based on ground target status. Include basic UI elements to show target locations and status.

## 2. Develop escort and protection mission mechanics [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create escort missions where players must protect allied aircraft or ground units
### Details:
Implement AI for allied units that need protection. Create threat assessment system for enemies targeting allies. Develop proximity tracking between player, allies and enemies. Implement mission failure conditions when allies are destroyed. Add UI elements showing ally health and status. Include difficulty scaling by adjusting enemy aggressiveness and ally vulnerability.

## 3. Create aerial refueling and precision flying challenges [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement refueling missions and other precision flying challenges requiring exact positioning and control
### Details:
Develop tanker aircraft with refueling boom/basket mechanics. Implement physics for successful connection and fuel transfer. Create precision flying challenges with tight spaces or specific flight paths. Add scoring system based on accuracy and time. Implement visual guides and feedback for player positioning. Include tutorial elements to teach players the mechanics.

## 4. Implement time trial and checkpoint missions [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Create time-based missions with checkpoints, racing elements, and time pressure
### Details:
Design checkpoint system with visible markers in 3D space. Implement timing system with countdown and elapsed time tracking. Create race courses with optimal paths and challenges. Add difficulty levels with different time requirements. Develop leaderboard system for comparing times. Include special obstacles or weather conditions to increase difficulty.

## 5. Add specialized mission mechanics for stealth and reconnaissance [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Implement stealth and reconnaissance mission types with detection systems and information gathering
### Details:
Create enemy detection systems based on visibility, noise, and radar signatures. Implement stealth mechanics including radar avoidance and terrain masking. Develop reconnaissance objectives requiring photographing or scanning targets. Add mission-specific equipment like cameras or sensors. Create UI elements showing detection status and gathered intelligence. Include mission failure conditions when detected in stealth missions.

## 6. Develop dynamic mission generation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Create a system for procedurally generating missions with variable conditions, objectives and environments
### Details:
Implement procedural generation for mission types, objectives, and difficulty. Create system for varying environmental conditions (time of day, weather, visibility). Develop mission parameter randomization within balanced constraints. Add mission progression system with increasing challenge. Implement mission variety tracking to ensure player experiences different types. Create mission rating system for player feedback and improvement.
