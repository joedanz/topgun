# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement mission system framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core mission system that handles objectives, triggers, and mission flow.
# Details:
Design a mission class with objectives, triggers, and completion criteria. Implement a mission loading and initialization system. Create objective types (destroy targets, protect allies, reach waypoints). Add mission-specific event triggers based on player actions or time. Implement mission success/failure conditions and scoring. Create a mission briefing and debriefing system. Add support for mission checkpoints and saving progress.

# Test Strategy:
Test mission loading and initialization with various mission types. Verify that objectives and triggers function correctly. Ensure mission completion logic works as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create core Mission class structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational Mission class with essential properties and methods
### Details:
Create a Mission class that includes: unique ID, title, description, status (not started, active, completed, failed), list of objectives, completion criteria, and reward data. Implement basic methods for mission initialization, activation, completion, and failure. Design the class to be extensible for different mission types. Include serialization support for saving/loading mission state.

## 2. Implement Objective system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the Objective base class and derived objective types
### Details:
Design an Objective base class with common properties (ID, description, status, completion criteria). Implement derived classes for different objective types: DestroyTargetObjective, ProtectAllyObjective, ReachWaypointObjective, CollectItemObjective, and TimedObjective. Each objective type should have specific completion logic, progress tracking, and validation methods. Include methods to check objective status and update progress.

## 3. Develop mission trigger system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a flexible event-based trigger system for missions
### Details:
Implement a MissionTrigger system that can activate based on various conditions: player location, time elapsed, enemy/ally status, item collection, or custom game events. Create a TriggerManager to register and process triggers. Design trigger actions that can start/complete objectives, spawn entities, display messages, or modify mission state. Include support for compound triggers (AND/OR logic between multiple conditions).

## 4. Build mission loading and management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create a MissionManager to handle mission lifecycle and state
### Details:
Implement a MissionManager singleton that handles: loading mission definitions from data files (JSON/XML), instantiating Mission objects, tracking active and completed missions, updating mission status based on game events, and managing mission transitions. Add support for mission dependencies (missions that require others to be completed first). Include methods to query available missions and mission status.

## 5. Implement mission UI and feedback systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.4
### Description: Create UI components for mission briefing, objectives, and status
### Details:
Design and implement: a mission briefing/debriefing screen with mission details and objectives, an in-game mission tracker showing current objectives and progress, notification system for objective updates and mission status changes, and a mission log/journal for reviewing active and completed missions. Ensure UI updates in real-time as mission status changes. Add support for mission-specific UI elements like waypoint markers and target indicators.

## 6. Add checkpoint and progress saving system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement functionality to save and restore mission progress
### Details:
Create a checkpoint system that saves mission state at key points. Implement serialization/deserialization of mission data, objective progress, and trigger states. Add methods to create automatic checkpoints at objective completion or at specific mission triggers. Design a system to restore mission state when loading a saved game. Include validation to prevent mission state corruption and handle edge cases like interrupted saves.
