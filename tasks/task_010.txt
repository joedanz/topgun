# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement mission system framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core mission system that handles objectives, triggers, and mission flow.
# Details:
Design a mission class with objectives, triggers, and completion criteria. Implement a mission loading and initialization system. Create objective types (destroy targets, protect allies, reach waypoints). Add mission-specific event triggers based on player actions or time. Implement mission success/failure conditions and scoring. Create a mission briefing and debriefing system. Add support for mission checkpoints and saving progress.

# Test Strategy:
Test mission loading and initialization with various mission types. Verify that objectives and triggers function correctly. Ensure mission completion logic works as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create core Mission class structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational Mission class with essential properties and methods
### Details:
Create a Mission class with properties for ID, name, description, status (not started, active, completed, failed), and objectives collection. Implement basic methods for initialization, activation, completion, and failure. Design the class to be extensible for future mission types. Include serialization support for saving/loading mission state.

## 2. Implement Objective system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create the Objective base class and specific objective type implementations
### Details:
Design an Objective base class with properties for description, status, and completion criteria. Implement derived classes for different objective types: DestroyTargetObjective, ProtectAllyObjective, ReachWaypointObjective. Each objective type should have specific validation logic and progress tracking. Include methods for checking completion status and updating progress.

## 3. Develop mission trigger system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a flexible trigger system that can respond to game events and player actions
### Details:
Implement a Trigger class hierarchy with various trigger types (location-based, time-based, action-based, entity-based). Create an event system that allows triggers to subscribe to relevant game events. Implement trigger activation and deactivation logic. Add support for compound triggers (AND/OR logic between multiple conditions). Ensure triggers can be serialized for save/load functionality.

## 4. Build mission loading and management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create a MissionManager to handle loading, tracking, and transitioning between missions
### Details:
Implement a MissionManager singleton that maintains the collection of available and active missions. Create methods for loading mission definitions from data files (JSON/XML). Add functionality to activate/deactivate missions based on game state. Implement mission dependency chains where completing one mission can unlock others. Include mission state persistence through save/load cycles.

## 5. Implement mission success/failure conditions and scoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Add logic for determining mission outcomes and calculating player performance
### Details:
Create a system for defining mission success and failure conditions using objectives and triggers. Implement scoring mechanisms based on completion time, objective success rate, and optional bonus objectives. Add support for mission-specific rewards (experience, items, unlocks). Create hooks for game systems to respond to mission state changes (UI updates, narrative progression).

## 6. Create mission briefing and checkpoint system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Implement UI components for mission information and progress saving functionality
### Details:
Design and implement mission briefing and debriefing UI screens showing objectives, context, and rewards. Create a checkpoint system that saves mission progress at key points. Implement mission log functionality to track active and completed missions. Add support for mission-specific hints and guidance. Ensure all UI elements update properly when mission state changes.
