# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create campaign structure and progression
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the narrative campaign system with mission sequencing and progression.
# Details:
Design a campaign structure with mission sequences and narrative elements. Create a campaign progress tracking system with persistent storage. Implement mission unlocking based on previous mission completion. Add narrative elements through briefings, cutscenes, or dialogue. Create a campaign map or menu for mission selection. Implement difficulty progression throughout the campaign. Add rewards and achievements for campaign milestones.

# Test Strategy:
Test campaign progression to ensure missions unlock correctly. Verify that narrative elements display properly. Ensure campaign progress saves correctly between sessions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design campaign data structure and storage system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data structures and persistent storage system for tracking campaign progress
### Details:
Implement a data model that defines campaign structure including missions, narrative elements, and player progress. Create a JSON-based campaign definition format that includes mission sequences, prerequisites, and narrative content references. Develop a persistent storage system using local storage or cloud saves to track player progress, completed missions, and unlocked content. Include serialization/deserialization methods for saving and loading campaign state.

## 2. Implement mission sequencing and unlocking logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create the system that manages mission progression and unlocking based on player achievements
### Details:
Build a mission manager class that loads the campaign structure and tracks current progress. Implement logic to determine which missions are available based on completion status of prerequisites. Create methods to mark missions as complete and update the persistent storage. Add functionality to handle branching mission paths if the campaign design includes multiple routes. Implement difficulty scaling parameters that increase challenge as the campaign progresses.

## 3. Develop campaign map/menu interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Create the visual interface for players to select missions and view campaign progress
### Details:
Design and implement a campaign map or menu UI that visually represents mission progression. Show completed, available, and locked missions with appropriate visual indicators. Include interactive elements to select missions and view mission details. Display campaign progress statistics and achievements. Implement smooth transitions and animations for mission selection and completion. Ensure the interface adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.

## 4. Create narrative delivery system [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Implement the system for presenting story elements through briefings, cutscenes, or dialogue
### Details:
Develop a narrative manager that loads and displays story content at appropriate campaign points. Implement a briefing system for pre-mission information and context. Create a basic cutscene system using in-game assets or pre-rendered content for key story moments. Add a dialogue system for character interactions if needed. Ensure narrative elements can be skipped but remain accessible for review. Include hooks for localization of all narrative content.

## 5. Implement rewards and achievement system [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Create the system for tracking and awarding campaign milestones and achievements
### Details:
Design and implement a reward system for campaign progression including unlockable content, abilities, or cosmetic items. Create an achievement system that tracks player accomplishments throughout the campaign. Implement visual and audio feedback for unlocking rewards and achievements. Add a UI component to the campaign menu for viewing earned rewards and achievements. Ensure rewards are properly saved in the persistent storage system and applied to gameplay when appropriate.
