# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement audio system with spatial sound
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive audio system using Web Audio API with spatial sound capabilities.
# Details:
Set up Web Audio API with appropriate context and listener. Implement 3D spatial audio for sound effects based on source position. Create audio categories (engine, weapons, explosions, UI) with volume controls. Add distance-based attenuation for sound effects. Implement Doppler effect for moving sound sources. Create a music system with crossfading between tracks. Add audio preloading and caching for performance. Implement mute functionality for background play.

# Test Strategy:
Test spatial audio accuracy with moving sound sources. Verify that volume controls work correctly for all categories. Ensure audio performance doesn't impact game performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Web Audio API core infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Web Audio API context and configure the audio listener for spatial sound
### Details:
Create a singleton AudioManager class that initializes the AudioContext. Set up the audio listener with proper positioning in the 3D space. Implement methods to update listener position and orientation based on camera/player position. Add error handling for browser compatibility issues and autoplay restrictions. Include a basic audio loading utility function.

## 2. Implement 3D spatial audio positioning system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create the core spatial audio functionality for positioning sound sources in 3D space
### Details:
Develop a SpatialSound class that takes a position vector and audio buffer. Configure PannerNodes with appropriate spatial settings (panning model, distance model, etc.). Implement methods to update sound source positions. Create utility functions for calculating audio parameters based on distance and position. Test with simple sound sources at different positions to verify proper 3D audio spatialization.

## 3. Create audio category system with volume controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement a category-based system for managing different types of audio with separate volume controls
### Details:
Define audio categories (engine, weapons, explosions, UI). Create a category management system with separate GainNodes for each category. Implement volume control methods for individual categories and master volume. Add persistence for volume settings using localStorage. Create an interface for connecting sounds to appropriate category chains. Build a simple UI for testing volume controls.

## 4. Implement distance attenuation and Doppler effect [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Add realistic distance-based volume reduction and Doppler effect for moving sound sources
### Details:
Configure distance models (linear, inverse, exponential) for different sound types. Implement custom rolloff curves for specific sound effects. Add velocity tracking to sound sources for Doppler effect calculation. Create a system to update velocity vectors for moving objects. Test with moving sound sources to verify proper Doppler shifting and distance attenuation.

## 5. Build music system with crossfading [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Create a background music system that supports smooth transitions between tracks
### Details:
Implement a MusicPlayer class that manages background music. Create crossfading functionality using multiple audio sources and gain nodes. Add methods for scheduling music changes with customizable transition times. Implement music zones for different game areas. Create event triggers for music changes. Add support for layered music tracks that can be mixed dynamically based on game state.

## 6. Implement audio preloading, caching and mute functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.5
### Description: Add performance optimizations through preloading and caching, plus mute functionality for background play
### Details:
Create an asset preloading system for audio files with progress tracking. Implement caching of decoded audio data to improve performance. Add memory management to unload unused audio assets. Create a global mute function that preserves individual volume settings. Implement background play detection and automatic muting when the tab loses focus. Add user controls for mute preferences. Test performance with many simultaneous sound sources.
