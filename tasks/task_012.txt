# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement audio system with spatial sound
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive audio system using Web Audio API with spatial sound capabilities.
# Details:
Set up Web Audio API with appropriate context and listener. Implement 3D spatial audio for sound effects based on source position. Create audio categories (engine, weapons, explosions, UI) with volume controls. Add distance-based attenuation for sound effects. Implement Doppler effect for moving sound sources. Create a music system with crossfading between tracks. Add audio preloading and caching for performance. Implement mute functionality for background play.

# Test Strategy:
Test spatial audio accuracy with moving sound sources. Verify that volume controls work correctly for all categories. Ensure audio performance doesn't impact game performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Web Audio API core infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Web Audio API context and configure the audio listener for spatial audio
### Details:
Create a singleton AudioManager class that initializes and manages the AudioContext. Set up the audio listener with appropriate positioning in the 3D space. Implement methods to update listener position and orientation based on camera/player position. Handle browser autoplay policies with user interaction requirements. Include error handling for unsupported browsers.

## 2. Implement audio resource loading and caching system [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a system to preload, decode and cache audio resources for efficient playback
### Details:
Develop an AudioLoader class that handles fetching audio files via fetch API, decoding them with AudioContext.decodeAudioData(), and storing in a cache. Implement priority loading for essential sounds. Add progress tracking for loading status. Support different audio formats (mp3, ogg) with fallbacks. Create a resource management system to prevent memory leaks by unloading unused audio.

## 3. Implement 3D spatial audio with distance attenuation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create a spatial audio system that positions sounds in 3D space with appropriate distance-based volume reduction
### Details:
Develop a SpatialAudio class that connects audio sources to PannerNodes for 3D positioning. Configure distance models (inverse, linear, exponential) for realistic attenuation. Implement methods to update sound source positions. Add rolloff factor configuration for fine-tuning distance attenuation. Include methods to convert game world coordinates to audio space coordinates.

## 4. Implement audio categories with volume controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create a category system for different audio types with independent volume controls
### Details:
Create an AudioCategory class to group related sounds (engine, weapons, explosions, UI). Implement GainNodes for each category to control volume levels. Add persistence for user volume preferences using localStorage. Create a UI component for volume adjustment. Implement methods to mute/unmute specific categories. Add master volume control that affects all categories.

## 5. Implement Doppler effect for moving sound sources [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Add Doppler effect simulation to create realistic audio for moving objects
### Details:
Extend the SpatialAudio class to track velocity of sound sources. Configure PannerNode Doppler settings (dopplerFactor, speedOfSound). Create a system to calculate velocity vectors from position changes over time. Implement methods to enable/disable Doppler effect for specific sound types. Add performance optimization to skip Doppler calculations for distant or insignificant sounds.

## 6. Implement background music system with crossfading [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.4
### Description: Create a music subsystem that supports smooth transitions between tracks
### Details:
Develop a MusicManager class that handles background music playback. Implement crossfading between tracks using multiple audio sources and GainNodes. Add methods for triggering music changes based on game events. Create a playlist system for sequential or random track selection. Implement music streaming for longer tracks to reduce memory usage. Add support for looping specific sections of tracks. Ensure music properly pauses/resumes when game loses/gains focus.
