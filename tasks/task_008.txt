# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop basic enemy AI for dogfights
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create AI-controlled enemy aircraft with basic dogfighting capabilities.
# Details:
Implement a state machine for enemy AI behavior (patrol, engage, evade). Create path finding and navigation systems for AI aircraft. Implement target tracking and prediction for AI weapons. Add difficulty levels affecting AI aggressiveness and accuracy. Create formation flying capabilities for groups of AI aircraft. Implement basic evasive maneuvers when under attack. Add performance limitations to ensure AI follows the same rules as players.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI behavior in various scenarios to ensure appropriate responses. Verify that AI difficulty scales correctly. Ensure AI performance is balanced and challenging but fair.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement AI state machine architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core state machine framework that will control enemy aircraft behavior transitions between patrol, engage, and evade states
### Details:
Design and implement a flexible state machine class that handles state transitions based on conditions. Define the three primary states (patrol, engage, evade) with clear entry/exit conditions. Include methods for state updates and transitions. Create a configuration system to store state-specific parameters that can be adjusted for different difficulty levels. Implement debug visualization to show current AI state during development.

## 2. Develop patrol behavior and navigation system [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement the patrol state behavior including waypoint following and basic navigation for AI aircraft
### Details:
Create a waypoint system that allows defining patrol routes. Implement smooth interpolation between waypoints with proper banking and altitude adjustments. Add randomization options to patrol patterns to increase unpredictability. Develop collision avoidance with terrain and other aircraft. Include performance limitations like turn radius, acceleration and speed constraints that match player aircraft capabilities.

## 3. Implement target detection and engagement logic [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create systems for AI aircraft to detect player aircraft and transition to engagement behavior
### Details:
Implement sensor simulation with configurable detection range and field of view. Create target prioritization logic when multiple potential targets exist. Add reaction time delay based on difficulty level. Implement line-of-sight checks to ensure realistic detection. Develop engagement decision making based on relative position, distance, and tactical advantage. Create smooth transition from patrol to engage state when targets are detected.

## 4. Develop target tracking and weapon systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create the AI's ability to track targets and use weapons effectively during engagement
### Details:
Implement predictive targeting that accounts for target velocity and acceleration. Create weapon selection logic based on range and engagement angle. Add accuracy variation based on difficulty level. Implement realistic weapon constraints like minimum range, lock-on requirements, and ammunition limits. Create aiming behavior with appropriate lead calculation for different weapon types. Add cooldown periods between weapon uses.

## 5. Implement evasive maneuvers and defensive behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create the evade state behavior with various defensive maneuvers when AI aircraft are under attack
### Details:
Implement threat detection from incoming missiles or when taking damage. Create a library of evasive maneuvers (barrel rolls, split-S, dive, etc.) with appropriate selection logic. Add countermeasure deployment (chaff/flares) with proper timing. Implement terrain-aware evasion to prevent crashes during defensive maneuvers. Create recovery behavior to re-engage after successful evasion. Scale evasion effectiveness with difficulty level.

## 6. Develop formation flying capabilities [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement the ability for multiple AI aircraft to fly in coordinated formations
### Details:
Create a formation manager that assigns relative positions to each aircraft in a group. Implement different formation types (V-formation, echelon, line abreast, etc.). Add dynamic spacing adjustment based on speed and maneuvers. Implement leader-follower hierarchy with role reassignment if the leader is destroyed. Create formation-wide tactical decision making for coordinated attacks and retreats. Add communication delay between formation members based on difficulty level.

## 7. Implement difficulty scaling and performance balancing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive difficulty system that adjusts AI capabilities across all behaviors
### Details:
Develop a central difficulty configuration system with presets (easy, medium, hard). Implement scaling for reaction time, accuracy, maneuver aggressiveness, and tactical decision making. Add performance limitations that ensure AI follows the same physical constraints as player aircraft. Create rubber-banding logic to keep engagements challenging but fair. Implement telemetry recording to analyze AI performance for balancing. Add difficulty-specific behaviors like more advanced tactics at higher difficulties.
