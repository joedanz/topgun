# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Three.js rendering foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic Three.js rendering pipeline to display 3D content with appropriate camera and lighting.
# Details:
Initialize a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer. Implement a responsive canvas that adjusts to window size. Set up basic lighting (ambient, directional) and skybox. Create a simple loading manager for 3D assets. Implement a render loop with requestAnimationFrame. Add basic camera controls for testing purposes. Configure renderer settings for performance (e.g., pixel ratio, antialiasing based on device).

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the renderer initializes correctly across different browsers. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window. Measure baseline FPS on target devices to ensure performance goals are achievable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Three.js core components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the fundamental Three.js objects: scene, camera, and renderer with responsive canvas
### Details:
Create a new Three.js Scene object. Initialize a PerspectiveCamera with appropriate field of view (75 degrees), aspect ratio based on window dimensions, and near/far clipping planes (0.1, 1000). Set up WebGLRenderer with a transparent background and append its canvas to the DOM. Implement a resize handler that updates the camera aspect ratio and renderer size when the window dimensions change. Enable device pixel ratio scaling for proper resolution on high-DPI displays.

## 2. Implement basic lighting system [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add ambient and directional lighting to illuminate the 3D scene
### Details:
Create an AmbientLight with a soft white color (0x404040) to provide base illumination. Add a DirectionalLight with a brighter color (0xffffff) positioned above the scene (e.g., x:1, y:1, z:1) to create shadows and depth. Enable shadows on the directional light with appropriate shadow map settings (size: 1024x1024). Add a helper object for the directional light during development to visualize its position and direction.

## 3. Create skybox environment [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement a skybox to provide background and environmental lighting
### Details:
Use CubeTextureLoader to load a set of 6 skybox textures (positive/negative x, y, z). Alternatively, use an HDR environment map with PMREMGenerator for more realistic lighting. Set the scene's background property to the loaded cube texture. Optionally implement environment mapping on reflective materials to interact with the skybox. Ensure proper texture compression and mipmap settings for performance.

## 4. Implement asset loading manager [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a loading system to handle 3D models and textures with progress tracking
### Details:
Initialize a Three.js LoadingManager with callbacks for onStart, onProgress, onLoad, and onError. Create helper functions to load different asset types (GLTFLoader for models, TextureLoader for textures). Implement a simple UI indicator to show loading progress. Add error handling to gracefully manage failed asset loads. Implement asset caching to prevent duplicate loading of the same resources.

## 5. Set up render loop and camera controls [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create the animation loop and implement interactive camera controls
### Details:
Implement a render function using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation. Add OrbitControls from Three.js examples to enable interactive camera manipulation (pan, zoom, rotate). Configure control constraints (min/max distance, polar angles) to prevent awkward camera positions. Implement performance optimizations like render throttling when inactive. Add stats.js monitoring during development to track frame rate. Ensure the render loop properly updates all animated components and controls.
