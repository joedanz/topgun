# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Three.js rendering foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic Three.js rendering pipeline to display 3D content with appropriate camera and lighting.
# Details:
Initialize a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer. Implement a responsive canvas that adjusts to window size. Set up basic lighting (ambient, directional) and skybox. Create a simple loading manager for 3D assets. Implement a render loop with requestAnimationFrame. Add basic camera controls for testing purposes. Configure renderer settings for performance (e.g., pixel ratio, antialiasing based on device).

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the renderer initializes correctly across different browsers. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window. Measure baseline FPS on target devices to ensure performance goals are achievable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Three.js core components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic Three.js scene, camera, and renderer with a responsive canvas
### Details:
Create a new JavaScript module that exports a class to manage the 3D environment. Initialize a Three.js Scene object. Create a PerspectiveCamera with appropriate field of view (75 degrees), aspect ratio based on container dimensions, and near/far planes (0.1, 1000). Set up a WebGLRenderer with alpha:true and antialias:true. Append the renderer's canvas to the target DOM element. Implement a resize handler that updates the camera aspect ratio and renderer size when the window or container changes size.

## 2. Implement lighting system [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up basic lighting including ambient and directional lights
### Details:
Add an AmbientLight with moderate intensity (0.5) and neutral color. Create a DirectionalLight with higher intensity (1.0) positioned to cast subtle shadows (position at x:5, y:10, z:7). Configure the directional light to cast shadows by setting castShadow to true and adjusting the shadow camera properties (left, right, top, bottom) to cover the scene. Add a HemisphereLight for more natural environmental lighting with sky color and ground color. Implement a method to adjust lighting based on scene content or time of day if needed.

## 3. Create skybox and environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement a skybox to provide background and environmental lighting
### Details:
Use CubeTextureLoader to load a set of 6 skybox textures (positive/negative x, y, z). Alternatively, use an HDR environment map with PMREMGenerator for more realistic reflections. Set the scene's background property to the loaded cube texture. If using HDR, convert to an envMap using PMREMGenerator. Create a method to easily switch between different skybox options. Ensure proper disposal of textures when changing environments to prevent memory leaks.

## 4. Implement asset loading manager [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create a loading system for 3D models and textures with progress tracking
### Details:
Create a LoadingManager instance to track overall loading progress. Implement event handlers for onStart, onProgress, onLoad, and onError. Create wrapper methods for loading different asset types: GLTFLoader for models, TextureLoader for textures, FontLoader for text, etc. Build a queue system to manage multiple asset loads. Implement a simple UI indicator to show loading progress. Add error handling with fallback assets when loads fail. Include methods to pre-load critical assets before scene initialization.

## 5. Set up render loop and camera controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement the animation loop and interactive camera controls
### Details:
Create an animation loop using requestAnimationFrame. Implement a time delta calculation to ensure consistent animation speeds regardless of frame rate. Add OrbitControls from Three.js examples to enable interactive camera manipulation. Configure control limits (min/max distance, pan boundaries, etc.). Implement performance optimizations: use renderer.setPixelRatio based on device capabilities, add stats.js for monitoring frame rate during development, implement adaptive quality settings that adjust renderer parameters based on performance measurements. Create a clean method to start/stop the render loop and dispose of resources when the component unmounts.
