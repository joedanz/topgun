# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create analytics and telemetry system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement systems for collecting gameplay data to inform future development and balance adjustments.
# Details:
Design an analytics system to track player progression and behavior. Implement event tracking for key gameplay actions. Create a telemetry system for performance monitoring. Add opt-in crash reporting. Implement heatmap generation for player movement and combat. Create a dashboard for visualizing analytics data. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

# Test Strategy:
Verify that analytics data is collected accurately. Test that privacy controls work correctly. Ensure telemetry doesn't impact game performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core analytics data collection framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational architecture for collecting, storing, and transmitting gameplay data
### Details:
Implement a singleton Analytics Manager class that handles event registration and dispatching. Create data models for different event types (gameplay, performance, errors). Design a queue system for batching events before transmission. Implement local storage for offline data collection. Ensure the system has minimal performance impact on gameplay by using asynchronous processing.

## 2. Implement gameplay event tracking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create specific event trackers for key gameplay actions and player progression metrics
### Details:
Define standard event types for player actions (combat, movement, item usage, level completion, etc.). Implement hooks in relevant game systems to capture these events. Add player progression tracking (XP gained, levels completed, achievements unlocked). Create session tracking to measure play duration and frequency. Implement funnel analysis capabilities to track player journey through game features.

## 3. Develop performance telemetry and crash reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Add systems to monitor game performance metrics and collect crash data
### Details:
Implement frame rate monitoring and reporting. Add memory usage tracking. Create system for logging and reporting exceptions and crashes with stack traces. Implement opt-in UI for crash reporting with privacy notice. Add device information collection (OS, hardware specs, etc.). Create automatic detection of performance anomalies. Ensure all crash data is anonymized appropriately.

## 4. Implement privacy compliance and data management [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Ensure the analytics system complies with privacy regulations and provides proper user controls
### Details:
Implement opt-in/opt-out functionality for all data collection. Create privacy policy text and consent UI. Add data anonymization for sensitive information. Implement data retention policies and automatic purging of old data. Create data export functionality for user data requests. Add IP anonymization. Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations. Document all data collection practices.

## 5. Create visualization dashboard and heatmap generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Develop tools to visualize collected analytics data including player movement and combat heatmaps
### Details:
Create a developer dashboard with charts and graphs for key metrics. Implement heatmap generation for player movement patterns. Add combat engagement heatmaps showing where players engage in combat most frequently. Create visualization for player progression and retention. Implement filtering capabilities by date range, player segments, and game versions. Add export functionality for reports. Create automated alerts for anomalous patterns in the data.
