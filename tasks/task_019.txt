# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create analytics and telemetry system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement systems for collecting gameplay data to inform future development and balance adjustments.
# Details:
Design an analytics system to track player progression and behavior. Implement event tracking for key gameplay actions. Create a telemetry system for performance monitoring. Add opt-in crash reporting. Implement heatmap generation for player movement and combat. Create a dashboard for visualizing analytics data. Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

# Test Strategy:
Verify that analytics data is collected accurately. Test that privacy controls work correctly. Ensure telemetry doesn't impact game performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design analytics data schema and collection architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core analytics architecture, data schema, and collection mechanisms that will be used throughout the system
### Details:
Create a comprehensive data schema that defines what player data will be collected, including player progression metrics, gameplay actions, and performance indicators. Design the architecture for how data will be collected, stored, and processed. Include data retention policies and anonymization methods to ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance. Document the API that game systems will use to report events. Consider both offline and online data collection scenarios.

## 2. Implement core event tracking and telemetry collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Build the foundational systems for tracking gameplay events and collecting performance telemetry
### Details:
Implement the core event tracking system based on the schema designed in subtask 1. Create event dispatchers for key gameplay actions (e.g., level completion, item acquisition, combat encounters). Add performance monitoring for critical metrics like framerate, memory usage, and load times. Implement data batching and efficient transmission to minimize performance impact. Include user opt-in/opt-out functionality for data collection with appropriate consent UI. Test the system with sample events to verify data integrity.

## 3. Develop crash reporting and error tracking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Create a system to capture, report, and analyze game crashes and errors
### Details:
Build an opt-in crash reporting system that captures stack traces, system information, and recent game state when crashes occur. Implement error boundary handlers to catch and report non-fatal errors. Create a server-side component to receive, store, and categorize crash reports. Add functionality to detect patterns in crash reports to identify common issues. Ensure all personally identifiable information is properly anonymized or excluded from reports. Include mechanisms for players to add notes to crash reports.

## 4. Implement spatial analytics and heatmap generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Create systems to track and visualize spatial player data throughout the game world
### Details:
Develop a spatial tracking system that records player positions, movement patterns, and interaction points in the game world. Implement efficient data structures for storing large volumes of spatial data. Create heatmap generation algorithms for visualizing player density, combat locations, deaths, and other key metrics. Add tools for developers to filter and analyze spatial data by player segments, time periods, and game versions. Optimize the collection system to minimize performance impact during gameplay.

## 5. Create analytics dashboard and visualization tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing collected gameplay data
### Details:
Build a web-based dashboard that visualizes all collected analytics data. Implement charts and graphs for player progression, retention, and engagement metrics. Integrate the heatmap visualizations from subtask 4. Create filtering and segmentation tools to analyze data across different player cohorts and time periods. Add export functionality for reports and raw data. Implement user management with appropriate access controls for the development team. Ensure the dashboard includes privacy compliance tools for data management and deletion requests.
