# Task ID: 14
# Title: Set up WebSocket server for multiplayer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the server infrastructure for real-time multiplayer gameplay using Socket.IO.
# Details:
Set up a Node.js server with Socket.IO for WebSocket communication. Implement room-based matchmaking for game sessions. Create authentication and session management. Design a protocol for efficient game state synchronization. Implement server-side validation to prevent cheating. Add reconnection handling for dropped connections. Create server monitoring and logging for debugging. Set up horizontal scaling capabilities for handling peak loads.

# Test Strategy:
Test server performance under various load conditions. Verify that connections remain stable during gameplay. Ensure that reconnection works correctly after connection loss.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up basic Node.js server with Socket.IO [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for the WebSocket server using Node.js and Socket.IO library
### Details:
Initialize a Node.js project with npm. Install Socket.IO and Express packages. Create a basic server that listens on a configurable port. Implement basic connection/disconnection event handlers. Set up CORS configuration to allow connections from the game client. Create a simple health check endpoint. Test basic connectivity with a simple client.

## 2. Implement authentication and session management [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create secure authentication system for players and manage their sessions
### Details:
Design authentication flow using JWT tokens. Implement middleware to validate authentication on connection. Create session storage using Redis or in-memory store. Add handlers for login/logout events. Implement session timeout and cleanup mechanisms. Create user identification system that persists across reconnections. Test authentication flow with mock clients.

## 3. Create room-based matchmaking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Develop a system to group players into game rooms for multiplayer sessions
### Details:
Design data structures for room management. Implement create/join/leave room functionality. Add matchmaking algorithm to pair players based on skill or other criteria. Create room lifecycle management (creation, active, closing). Implement room capacity limits and waiting queues. Add room metadata storage for game settings. Test room creation and joining with multiple clients.

## 4. Design and implement game state synchronization protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Create an efficient protocol for transmitting game state between server and clients
### Details:
Design data format for game state updates (consider JSON or binary protocols). Implement delta compression to minimize bandwidth usage. Create server-side game state manager. Add broadcast mechanisms for state updates to room members. Implement targeted updates for player-specific information. Create throttling mechanism to control update frequency. Test synchronization with simulated game states and multiple clients.

## 5. Implement server-side validation and anti-cheat measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Add validation logic to prevent cheating and ensure game integrity
### Details:
Identify critical game actions requiring validation. Implement server-side physics/game logic for validation. Create rate limiting for player actions. Add position/movement validation to detect speedhacks. Implement server authority model where server has final say on game state. Create reporting system for suspicious activity. Test with deliberately invalid inputs to verify protection.

## 6. Add reconnection handling and connection resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Implement mechanisms to handle network disruptions and client reconnections
### Details:
Create connection state tracking for each client. Implement temporary state preservation for disconnected players. Add grace period configuration for reconnections. Create reconnection protocol with session resumption. Implement missed update handling for reconnected clients. Add heartbeat mechanism to detect zombie connections. Test with forced disconnections and network throttling.

## 7. Set up monitoring, logging and horizontal scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.6
### Description: Implement infrastructure for server observability and scaling to handle increased load
### Details:
Set up structured logging with levels (debug, info, warning, error). Implement performance metrics collection (connections, rooms, message rate). Create dashboard for real-time monitoring. Add load balancing configuration with sticky sessions. Implement Redis or other shared storage for cross-server state. Create containerization setup with Docker. Configure auto-scaling rules based on server load. Test with load simulation tools to verify scaling capabilities.
