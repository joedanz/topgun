# Task ID: 14
# Title: Set up WebSocket server for multiplayer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the server infrastructure for real-time multiplayer gameplay using Socket.IO.
# Details:
Set up a Node.js server with Socket.IO for WebSocket communication. Implement room-based matchmaking for game sessions. Create authentication and session management. Design a protocol for efficient game state synchronization. Implement server-side validation to prevent cheating. Add reconnection handling for dropped connections. Create server monitoring and logging for debugging. Set up horizontal scaling capabilities for handling peak loads.

# Test Strategy:
Test server performance under various load conditions. Verify that connections remain stable during gameplay. Ensure that reconnection works correctly after connection loss.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up basic Node.js server with Socket.IO [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation for the WebSocket server using Node.js and Socket.IO library
### Details:
Initialize a Node.js project with npm. Install Socket.IO and Express packages. Create a basic server that listens on a configurable port. Implement basic connection/disconnection event handlers. Set up CORS configuration for development and production environments. Create a simple health check endpoint. Test basic connectivity with a minimal client implementation.

## 2. Implement authentication and session management [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create secure authentication flow and session handling for multiplayer connections
### Details:
Design authentication middleware for Socket.IO connections. Implement JWT validation for connection requests. Create session storage using Redis or a similar in-memory database. Develop session lifecycle management (creation, validation, expiration). Add rate limiting to prevent abuse. Implement user identification and tracking. Test authentication flow with mock users and sessions.

## 3. Create room-based matchmaking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Develop a system to group players into game rooms and manage room lifecycles
### Details:
Design data structures for room management. Implement room creation, joining, and leaving logic. Create matchmaking algorithms based on player skill/preferences. Add room capacity limits and validation. Implement room lifecycle events (creation, player joining/leaving, game start/end, room closure). Create admin commands for room management. Test matchmaking with simulated player connections.

## 4. Design and implement game state synchronization protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Create an efficient protocol for transmitting game state between server and clients
### Details:
Design a data schema for game state objects. Implement serialization/deserialization of game states. Create delta compression to minimize bandwidth usage. Add message sequencing and ordering mechanisms. Implement broadcast and targeted message sending. Create throttling mechanisms to prevent flooding. Develop state reconciliation for handling latency. Test protocol efficiency with simulated game actions.

## 5. Implement server-side validation and anti-cheat measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Add validation logic to prevent cheating and ensure game integrity
### Details:
Implement server authority for critical game actions. Create validation rules for player actions and state changes. Add anomaly detection for suspicious behavior. Implement server-side physics/logic verification where needed. Create reporting and moderation tools. Design progressive penalties for detected cheating. Test validation with intentionally invalid inputs and edge cases.

## 6. Add reconnection handling and connection resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Implement mechanisms to handle dropped connections and allow players to rejoin games
### Details:
Create connection state tracking for each client. Implement timeout detection for inactive connections. Design game state preservation for disconnected players. Add reconnection authentication and validation. Implement grace periods for reconnection attempts. Create notifications for other players about connection status. Test reconnection scenarios with forced disconnections.

## 7. Set up monitoring, logging, and horizontal scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.6
### Description: Implement infrastructure for server monitoring, debugging, and handling increased load
### Details:
Set up structured logging with different severity levels. Implement performance metrics collection (connections, rooms, message throughput). Create dashboards for real-time monitoring. Add alerting for critical issues. Implement load balancing across multiple server instances. Set up sticky sessions for connection persistence. Create deployment scripts for horizontal scaling. Test scaling with load simulation tools.
